## ADR 004: Data Source – yfinance

### Context
We need reliable financial market data to power portfolio analytics (real-time or near real-time pricing, historical data). The source must be accessible, affordable, and straightforward to integrate into our backend service.

### Options
- **yfinance** – A Python wrapper for Yahoo Finance, free and widely adopted. Provides historical and delayed real-time data with straightforward integration.  
- **Alpha Vantage** – Offers a free tier with stock, FX, and crypto data. Has good documentation but strict rate limits.  
- **Polygon.io** – A professional-grade API with real-time and historical data, but requires a paid plan for most meaningful usage.  

### Decision
We chose **yfinance** because it provides sufficient coverage for equities and ETFs, integrates seamlessly with Python, and has no upfront cost.
Compared to Alpha Vantage, yfinance is easier to use with fewer restrictions and no need for an API key.
Compared to Polygon.io, it avoids the complexity and cost of a commercial API in the early stages of the project.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- **Pros**: Free, widely used, integrates well with Python, adequate for MVP.  
- **Cons**: Reliant on Yahoo’s data source, which may have inconsistencies or delays.  
- **Future Flexibility**: If we need guaranteed uptime, lower latency, or more advanced coverage (options, real-time feeds), we may later adopt Alpha Vantage or Polygon.io.
