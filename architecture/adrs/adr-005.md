## ADR 005: Authentication – JWT/OAuth2

### Context
We need secure, scalable authentication to protect accounts and support personalization.  

### Options
- JWT/OAuth2 – Stateless, scalable, widely adopted.  
- Session-based – Simpler but less scalable for APIs.  
- API keys – Useful for services, but insecure for end-users.  

### Decision
We chose JWT with OAuth2 because it is the most scalable option.
Compared to session-based authentication, JWT avoids server-side state, which simplifies scaling.
Compared to API keys, JWT provides stronger security with token expiry and refresh mechanisms. This approach aligns with FastAPI’s built-in security tools.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Stateless scaling is supported.  
- Implementation of refresh tokens adds complexity.  
- Strong community support makes setup easier.
