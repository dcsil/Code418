## ADR 001: Frontend Framework – Next.js

### Context
We need a frontend framework to build a responsive, modular web application that supports dynamic dashboards, gamified learning, and backend API integration. Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) could improve performance and SEO.  

### Options
- Next.js – React-based framework with SSR/SSG, routing, and API routes.  
- React (standalone) – Flexible, widely adopted, but requires manual routing and SSR setup.  
- Vue.js – Lightweight and approachable, but less enterprise adoption and ecosystem maturity.  
- Angular – Full-featured but heavy and opinionated.  

### Decision
We chose **Next.js** because it extends React with server-side rendering, static generation, and built-in routing. 
Compared to plain React, Next.js reduces boilerplate and provides better performance and SEO. Compared to Vue, Next.js has stronger enterprise adoption and more resources.
Compared to Angular, Next.js is less opinionated, easier to integrate, and quicker for iterative development.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Built-in SSR and SSG improve performance and user experience.  
- Simpler routing compared to vanilla React.  
- Must learn Next.js conventions in addition to React.
