## ADR 003: Database & ORM – PostgreSQL + Prisma

### Context
We need a structured database to store user portfolios, learning modules, quiz history, and progress tracking.  

### Options
- PostgreSQL + Prisma – Robust relational DB with type-safe queries.  
- MySQL + SQLAlchemy – Reliable but weaker JSON support.
- MongoDB – Flexible schema but not ideal for relational data.  

### Decision
We chose PostgreSQL with Prisma because it combines strong relational features with type-safe queries.
Compared to MySQL, PostgreSQL offers better JSON support and richer query features, which matter for analytics.
Compared to MongoDB, PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and consistency, which is essential for financial and learning data.
Prisma adds developer productivity with type safety compared to lower-level ORMs.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Ensures data consistency for financial and learning records.  
- Type safety reduces runtime errors.  
- Some complex queries may be harder with Prisma.
