## ADR 008: Monitoring – Sentry & Datadog

### Context
We need both application and infrastructure monitoring to ensure reliability.  

### Options
- Sentry + Datadog – Full coverage.  
- Sentry only – Application-level only.  
- Datadog only – Infrastructure-level only.  

### Decision
We chose Sentry for application monitoring and Datadog for infrastructure monitoring.
Compared to using just one, the combination ensures full visibility.
Compared to Sentry-only, it adds infrastructure monitoring.
Compared to Datadog-only, it ensures detailed app error tracking. Together they provide balanced, complementary coverage.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Improves reliability with fast detection of issues.  
- Adds integration effort and cost.  
- Provides strong long-term operational support.
