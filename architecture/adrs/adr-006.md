## ADR 006: AI Integration – OpenAI API

### Context
We want to deliver adaptive insights + learning and personalized suggestions based on portfolios and goals.  

### Options
- OpenAI API – High-quality, reliable, but paid.  
- HuggingFace Models – Open-source, requires self-hosting.  
- No AI – Simpler, but no personalization.  

### Decision
We chose OpenAI API because it provides immediate access to advanced models.
Compared to HuggingFace, it avoids the infrastructure overhead of self-hosting.
Compared to no AI, it differentiates our product with personalization features.
Cost is of course a drawback, but the trade-off is acceptable for faster iteration.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Enables personalization early on.  
- Introduces API costs.  
- Can migrate to open-source later if needed.
