## ADR 002: Backend Framework – FastAPI

### Context
We need a backend that can expose APIs for portfolio analytics, AI integration, and authentication. It should integrate well with Python libraries like `yfinance`.  

### Options
- FastAPI – Async-first, modern, built-in OpenAPI documentation.  
- Flask – Simple, but synchronous by default and requires more setup.  
- Django – Comprehensive, but heavy for an API-focused service.  

### Decision
We chose FastAPI because it provides async performance and clear API documentation.
Compared to Flask, it requires less boilerplate and provides stronger performance out of the box.
Compared to Django, FastAPI is lighter and faster to set up for APIs without the overhead of an entire web framework.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Strong concurrency support.  
- Ecosystem is smaller than Django but sufficient for our needs.  
- Must understand async programming.
