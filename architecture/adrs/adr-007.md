## ADR 007: Hosting & Infrastructure – Vercel + Render + Neon

### Context
We need hosting for frontend, backend, and database with minimal DevOps overhead.  

### Options
- Vercel + Render + Neon – Managed services, developer-friendly.  
- AWS EC2 + RDS – More control, but complex and heavy.  
- Heroku – Easy, but limited scalability.  

### Decision
We chose Vercel for frontend, Render for backend, and Neon for database.
Compared to AWS, this setup reduces operational complexity and speeds up development.
Compared to Heroku, it offers better scalability and modern workflows.
The trade-off is less control than AWS, but the reduced DevOps burden is more important for our project.  

### Status
Accepted – 2025-10-01  

### Consequences
- Enables independent scaling of each layer.  
- Reduced DevOps work compared to AWS.  
- Using multiple providers introduces slight integration complexity.
