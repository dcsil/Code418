## CUJs

### CUJ 1: Portfolio Setup and Analytics

From the dashboard or portfolio page, the user clicks a button and enters the ticker of a new position. They enter the quantity and average cost and click a button to add the position to their portfolio. The portfolio is updated with the new position and the user is redirected to the portfolio page where they can see their updated portfolio and view analytics about their portfolio based on real-time price data.

### CUJ 2: Personalized Learning Pathway

When signing up, the user answers a short onboarding quiz about their financial goals and current knowledge (e.g., saving for retirement, risk tolerance, familiarity with investing terms). The AI generates a personalized pathway with beginner-friendly modules. The user sees their recommended first module and clicks on it to begin learning. The user reads the module and completes a series of multiple choice questions to test their understanding. At the end of the module, the user sees a congratulatory popup and is prompted to continue to the next module.

### CUJ 3: Adaptive AI Learning Suggestions
