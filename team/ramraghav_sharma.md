## About Ram

I'm a fourth year computer science student interested in machine learning research and engineering. 

I'm currently working as a researcher at the Toronto Intelligent Systems lab on ML research for robotics. I've also worked as an ML Engineer at Whatnot (YC W20) and Shopify. 


## Strengths

- I have strong opinions about products and always have something to complain about in apps I use.
- I get stuff done.

## Weaknesses

- I sometimes spend too long on small details which ends up cutting it close with deadlines.
