Diversity
---

Diversity is more than just counting demographic boxes — it’s about ensuring that the people who make decisions bring a variety of lived experiences, thought processes, and problem-solving styles. For us, diversity means being aware of the ways we might all think alike, and deliberately looking for perspectives that challenge us. We recognize that building good technology is not just a technical exercise but a human one, and diversity helps us design tools that are more inclusive, ethical, and robust. By acknowledging where our team is strong and where it is homogenous, we create space to invite input from others and make better, fairer decisions.

Team Background
---

Our team shares a deep common foundation in computer science and engineering, but our individual paths have shaped us into very different kinds of thinkers. Jason pairs his Computer Science studies with Cognitive Science, giving him an interest in how people think and interact with technology; his experience working in startups and at companies like theScore has made him efficient at building polished, user-facing products. Ram is a researcher at the Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab and has spent time working on applied ML problems at Whatnot and Shopify, which makes him deeply thoughtful about the performance and reliability of machine learning models. Roy combines software engineering with financial economics, having worked as a Quantitative Developer and SRE, giving him a unique strength in systems thinking and analytical modeling. Saket brings a mix of physics, mathematics, and computer science with a focus on entrepreneurship and building startups, which gives him a strong product-oriented lens and an eye for real-world impact. Collectively, we have lived or worked in multiple countries, speak several languages, and bring together experiences across research, industry, and startups. This blend of perspectives helps us see problems from both an academic and practical angle.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

As a group, our biggest strength is our technical versatility and ability to execute. Between us, we can design, implement, and deploy full-stack applications, train machine learning models, and think about scalability and performance. We are comfortable with modern tools and workflows, meaning we can move quickly from an idea to a working prototype. Another strength is our combination of research-minded and execution-focused personalities: we have people who think deeply about fundamentals and others who thrive on shipping and iterating fast, which helps us strike a balance between rigor and speed. However, we are aware of some weaknesses as well. None of us have formal training in UX design, accessibility, or user research, so we risk building products that are technically sound but not always user-friendly for all audiences. Our similar academic and socio-economic backgrounds can also lead to groupthink, where we all see the problem from the same perspective. Finally, because many of us have busy schedules and take on multiple projects at once, there’s a risk of time crunches or uneven workload distribution if we don’t communicate well.

### Subject Matter Experts

To fill these gaps, we would benefit from working with people whose expertise complements ours. A UX researcher or designer could help us test our assumptions about usability and design interfaces that are welcoming to users with different abilities and levels of technical literacy. Someone experienced in accessibility could ensure that what we build works for screen readers, users with visual or auditory impairments, and people using older devices or slower internet. Engaging with an AI ethics or fairness expert — whether a professor, teaching assistant, or practitioner — could help us think critically about bias in datasets, privacy implications, and responsible deployment of our systems. Finally, involving actual end-users outside our immediate demographic — older adults, people new to technology, or users from different cultural or geographic backgrounds — would be invaluable for uncovering blind spots and making sure our solution works for the people who most need it.

## Diversity

Although our team has a mix of cultural and academic backgrounds, we are still relatively homogenous in several ways. We are all students at the University of Toronto, most of us are men, and we all come from STEM fields. This means we lack representation from women or non-binary team members, people from disciplines like the arts, humanities, or social sciences, and those with lived experience of disability or accessibility needs. While we do bring some diversity through different cultural backgrounds, interests, and career goals, we recognize that we are not as representative of the larger population as we could be. Acknowledging this is important because it helps us identify where we might have blind spots and motivates us to reach out for feedback from a more diverse set of voices.

### How this can impact us

The risk of not addressing these blind spots is that we might build something that works beautifully for us but unintentionally excludes or frustrates other users. Without representation from people with different levels of tech familiarity, we might overestimate how intuitive our product is or use language that is confusing to newcomers. Without considering accessibility, we might design interfaces that are visually appealing but impossible to navigate with a screen reader. Without thinking about ethics and fairness, we might allow bias to creep into our models or decision-making logic. Actively seeking input from people who differ from us — whether by gender, background, culture, or ability — can help us avoid these pitfalls and make our work more inclusive. Doing so not only improves our product’s usability but also broadens its potential impact, helping us build something that truly benefits everyone and not just people who think like we do.

Diversity is about bringing together people with different experiences, identities, and ways of thinking. For our team, it means being aware of where we might all think similarly and actively seeking perspectives that challenge us. We know that good technology comes from designing for a wide range of users, not just the people building it.

Team Background
---

Our team shares a strong foundation in computer science and engineering but brings different strengths. Jason combines CS with Cognitive Science and has experience shipping front-end features at startups and tech companies. Ram contributes a research mindset from robotics and ML work at Whatnot and Shopify. Roy blends software engineering and finance, adding a systems and analytics perspective. Saket brings physics, math, and entrepreneurship, focusing on building solutions with real-world impact. Together, we’ve lived or worked in different countries, speak multiple languages, and have experience across research, industry, and startups.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our main strength is technical versatility — we can build full-stack applications, deploy ML systems, and think about performance and scalability. We also balance research-minded thinking with a bias for execution, letting us move quickly while staying thoughtful. Our weaknesses are in areas like UX design, accessibility, and user research, where none of us have formal training. We also share similar educational and socio-economic backgrounds, which can limit the diversity of our perspectives.

### Subject Matter Experts

To address these gaps, we’d benefit from input outside our domain. A UX researcher could help us validate our assumptions about usability, and an accessibility expert could ensure we design for all users. An AI ethics mentor or professor could guide us on bias and privacy issues. Most importantly, getting feedback from non-technical users and people with different lived experiences would help us catch blind spots early.

## Diversity

Our team has some diversity in culture and academic focus, but we remain fairly homogenous in other ways. Most of us identify as male and come from STEM backgrounds. We lack representation from women or non-binary team members, people from the arts or humanities, and those with experience navigating accessibility challenges. Recognizing this helps us stay conscious of the voices missing from the room.

### How this can impact us

Without these perspectives, we risk building products that work well for us but leave out other users. We might assume a level of technical literacy that many people don’t have or overlook accessibility needs. By seeking feedback from a broader set of users and experts, we can make our product more inclusive, fair, and impactful — creating something that feels welcoming and usable for everyone.
