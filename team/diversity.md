# Bias and Diversity Reflection

Diversity is about bringing together people with different lived experiences, thought processes, and ways of seeing the world. For our team, it means being conscious of where we think alike, where we might have blind spots, and seeking out perspectives that challenge our assumptions. We believe diversity makes products better because it forces us to design for people who are not just like us, which leads to more inclusive and resilient solutions.

## Team Background

Our team has a varied background. Jason blends Computer Science and Cognitive Science, focusing on front-end development and user experience from his time at startups and theScore. Ram brings a research mindset from his work at the Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab and internships in ML at Whatnot and Shopify. Roy combines software engineering with financial economics and has experience as a Quantitative Developer and SRE, giving him a strong systems and analytics perspective. Saket contributes a mix of physics, math, computer science, and entrepreneurship, with experience building startups and shipping AI-driven solutions. Together we have lived or worked in multiple countries, speak several languages, and have experience across research, startups, and large organizations, giving us both academic and practical perspectives.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team has strong technical breadth — we can build full-stack applications, deploy ML models, and think about performance, scalability, and product impact. We balance research-oriented thinking with a bias for execution, which lets us move quickly while still being thoughtful. Moreover, many of use have experience in startups, which gives us a good understanding of the challenges and opportunities of building products.

However, none of us have formal training in UX design, accessibility, or user research, so we risk building tools that are technically strong but not always user-friendly for all audiences. We also share similar educational and socio-economic backgrounds, which can lead to groupthink or over-optimizing for technically skilled users. Moreover, we are all in our 20s, which can lead to a lack of experience with older users and people from different cultures. Communication and workload balancing are areas we watch carefully, since many of us juggle busy schedules and multiple projects. As a result, we need to be mindful of our biases when making key decisions, as well as seek out feedback from diverse end-users to ensure we are building the right product.

## Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts (SMEs) who can help us address our expertise gaps are UX and accessibility researchers who can guide us in designing interfaces that work for users with different needs and abilities. We would benefit from input from AI ethics or fairness experts to help us consider privacy and bias implications in our work. Product managers or designers could help us prioritize features around user value rather than just technical complexity. Most importantly, feedback from diverse end-users — especially non-technical users and people from outside our immediate demographic — would help us test our assumptions and uncover blind spots early.

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we lack diversity in specific areas.

First, we currently have no representation from women, non-binary members, people from other age groups, or people with lived experience of disability.

Beyond these visible dimensions, we do not have people experienced in design, accessibility, or HCI. We also share similar educational paths through STEM fields, so we lack voices from the arts, humanities, or social sciences who could bring different approaches to problem-solving. Recognizing these gaps helps us stay mindful of the perspectives we might miss and encourages us to actively seek input from people unlike ourselves.

### How this can impact us

A potential impact of this is that we could unintentionally build solutions that serve people like us very well but exclude others — for example, by assuming a certain level of technical literacy, neglecting accessibility features, or failing to account for ethical and fairness considerations. People with backgrounds that differ from our own can help us in the technology industry because they bring new ways of framing problems, uncover usability and ethical issues we may overlook, and help ensure that what we build is usable, fair, and welcoming to a broader audience.
