# Team Principles

## Communication
- Our Instagram group chat is where everything happens.  
- Keep messages clear and respectful. Jokes and memes are fine, but not if they make things confusing.  
- Tag people if you need a response from them specifically.  
- Try to check the chat once a day (Mon–Fri). If you’ll be offline longer, let us know.  
- Feel free to use screenshots, voice notes, or whatever makes explaining easier.

## Meetings
- We’ll schedule meetings together in the group chat.  
- Come prepared with updates so we don’t waste time.  
- If you can’t make it, let the group know early, drop your update in the chat, and catch up later.  
- Roles like note-taking or leading a meeting can rotate so it’s not always on the same person.

## Work
- We’ll divide tasks as evenly as we can based on deadlines and workload.  
- If something’s taking longer than expected, speak up so others can help out.  
- Try to finish work early enough so others have time to look it over — last-minute dumps make it hard to review.  
- We’ll use shared docs (Google Drive, GitHub, etc.) when needed to keep things organized.

## Feedback & Growth
- Keep feedback constructive — focus on the work, not the person.  
- Shout out wins, big or small. Effort counts as much as results.  
- Mistakes happen — use them to learn.

## Conflict Resolution
- If disagreements come up, bring them up respectfully in chat or 1-on-1.  
- If it gets tricky, another teammate can help mediate.  
- The goal is always to fix the issue, not blame someone.
